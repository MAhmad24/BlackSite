BLACKSITE 2D
A 2D top-down roguelite extraction shooter inspired by COD Zombies. Built from scratch as a learning project in Unity.
About
This is my first complete game project. I'm learning Unity and C# by building a wave-based survival shooter with extraction mechanics and a PS1-era aesthetic. The goal is to combine the tension of COD Zombies with roguelite progression and risk/reward extraction decisions.
